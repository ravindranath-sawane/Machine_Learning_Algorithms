#Decision Tree Classification
Decision tree builds classification or regression models in the form of a tree structure. 
It breaks down a dataset into smaller and smaller subsets while at the same time an associated decision tree is incrementally developed. 
The final result is a tree with decision nodes and leaf nodes. A decision node (e.g., Outlook) has two or more branches (e.g., Sunny, Overcast and Rainy). Leaf node (e.g., Play) represents a classification or decision. The topmost decision node in a tree which corresponds to the best predictor called root node. Decision trees can handle both categorical and numerical data.
