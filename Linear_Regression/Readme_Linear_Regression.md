# What is Regression??
Regression is a method of modelling a target value based on independent predictors. This method is mostly used for forecasting and finding out cause and effect relationship between variables. Regression techniques mostly differ based on the number of independent variables and the type of relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

# What is Linear Regression?
Simple linear regression is a type of regression analysis where the number of independent variables is one and there is a linear relationship between the independent(x) and dependent(y) variable. The red line in the above graph is referred to as the best fit straight line. Based on the given data points, we try to plot a line that models the points the best. The line can be modelled based on the linear equation shown below.
y = a_0 + a_1 * x      ## Linear Equation

Linear Regression is an algorithm that every Machine Learning enthusiast must know and it is also the right place to start for people who want to learn Machine Learning as well. It is really a simple but useful algorithm.
